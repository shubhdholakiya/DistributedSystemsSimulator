# Distributed Systems Simulator 🚀

This project is a simple Distributed Systems Simulator that I built using **React** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend. It helps visualize how distributed nodes work and simulate communication between them.

The app fetches a list of nodes from the backend, displays their status, and lets you simulate a communication round. Pretty neat for getting a feel of distributed systems in action.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Chart.js (`react-chartjs-2`)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Proxy Setup:** React dev server proxies API requests to Flask

- Displays node statuses dynamically
- Visualizes statuses with a bar chart
- Simulate communication between nodes with one click
